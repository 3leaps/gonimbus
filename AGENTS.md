# Gonimbus – AI Agent Guide

**Project**: gonimbus
**Purpose**: Cloud object storage crawl/inspect engine (library + CLI + server)
**Maintainers**: See `MAINTAINERS.md`

## Operating Model

| Aspect   | Setting                                  |
| -------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Mode     | Supervised (human reviews before commit) |
| Role     | devlead (default)                        |
| Identity | Per session (no persistent memory)       |

See [3leaps-crucible agent-identity standard](https://crucible.3leaps.dev/repository/agent-identity) for operating modes and attribution patterns.

## Read First

1. **Confirm your role.** Roles are defined below. Default to `devlead` if unspecified.
2. **Check `AGENTS.local.md`** if it exists (gitignored) for tactical session guidance.
3. **Read `MAINTAINERS.md`** for human maintainer contacts.
4. **Read files before editing them.**

## Quick Reference

| Task           | Command          | Notes                 |
| -------------- | ---------------- | --------------------- |
| Quality checks | `make check-all` | Run before committing |
| Tests          | `make test`      | Must pass             |
| Format         | `make fmt`       | Auto-format code      |
| Build          | `make build`     | Build binary          |
| Run            | `make run`       | Start dev server      |

## Role-Based Development

Agents operate in role contexts. Each role has defined scope.

| Role       | Focus                                     |
| ---------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| `devlead`  | Core implementation, CLI, integration     |
| `provider` | S3/GCS providers, auth chains, SDK wiring |
| `crawler`  | Crawl engine, matching, outputs, pipeline |
| `qa`       | Testing, validation, coverage             |

When assigned a role, constrain actions to that scope.

### devlead – Development Lead

- **Scope**: Core implementation, CLI commands, cross-cutting coordination
- **Responsibilities**: Feature implementation, code review, integration, release prep
- **Escalates to**: maintainers for releases, breaking changes

### provider – Provider & Auth

- **Scope**: Provider implementations (S3, GCS), auth chains, SDK integration
- **Responsibilities**: Provider interface, credential handling, endpoint configuration
- **Escalates to**: devlead for API design decisions

### crawler – Crawl Engine

- **Scope**: Crawl engine, pattern matching, prefix derivation, outputs
- **Responsibilities**: Pipeline implementation, JSONL writer, backpressure, rate limiting
- **Escalates to**: devlead for architecture decisions

### qa – Quality Assurance

- **Scope**: Testing strategy, coverage, validation
- **Responsibilities**: Test suites, integration tests, schema validation
- **Escalates to**: devlead for test infrastructure decisions

## Session Protocol

### Startup

1. Read `AGENTS.local.md` if exists (tactical overrides)
2. Identify your role from context or request assignment
3. Scan relevant code before making changes

### Before Committing

1. Run quality gates: `make check-all`
2. Verify tests pass
3. Stage all modified files
4. Use proper attribution format

### Escalation

Escalate to maintainers (see `MAINTAINERS.md`) for:

- Releases and version tags
- Breaking changes
- Security concerns
- Architectural decisions

## Commit Attribution

```

**Example:**

```
feat(provider): add S3 provider with default auth chain

Implements S3 provider using AWS SDK v2 default configuration.

Changes:
- Add pkg/provider/s3/provider.go with List/Head operations
- Support custom endpoints for S3-compatible stores
- Wire default credential chain (env, profiles, assume-role)

## DO / DO NOT

### DO

- Run `make check-all` before commits
- Read files before editing them
- Keep changes minimal and focused
- Test manually when changing CLI behavior
- Document decisions in code comments or docs/

### DO NOT

- Push without maintainer approval
- Skip quality gates
- Commit secrets or credentials
- Commit `.plans/` contents (gitignored)
- Create unnecessary files
- Touch code outside your task scope
