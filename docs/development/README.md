# Developer Guides Index

This directory collects focused guides for Gonimbus development. Start with `README.md` for project overview, then use these guides for deep dives on specific topics.

## Available Guides

- [Gonimbus Overview](../gonimbus-overview.md) - Product vision and operational modes
- [Architecture](../architecture.md) - Component design and system architecture
- [Non-Goals](../non-goals.md) - Explicit scope boundaries (what gonimbus is NOT)
- [Testing Strategy](testing.md) - Unit tests, cloud integration tests, and coverage philosophy
- [CI Configuration](ci.md) - Container-based CI/CD setup
- [Accessing Crucible Documentation via gofulmen](accessing-crucible-docs-via-gofulmen.md) - Learn how to read embedded Crucible docs, schemas, and config shipped with gofulmen
- [Metrics Reference](../metrics.md) - Prometheus metrics documentation
- [AWS Profile Authentication](../auth/aws-profiles.md) - Enterprise SSO and profile-based authentication

## Planning Artifacts

Feature briefs and implementation plans are maintained in `.plans/active/` (gitignored).

As new processes stabilize, add additional guides here so the index stays the single stop for topic-specific references.
